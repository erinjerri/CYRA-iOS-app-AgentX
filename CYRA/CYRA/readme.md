# Create Your Reality Agent (CYRA) App
* Initial prototype with OpenAI. Later version with OpenAI Operator.
* Built for UC Berkeley LLM Agents (Advanced) course, after a hackathon last year (VisionDevCamp winning Best Productivity app for app concept) and undergoing Women in Big Data solopreneurship program.
* This project actually tries to build a real prototype with real data.
This project is a quick MVP for computer use agents and will use Lambda.

### Future Directions
* We also have a web app (Flask), but this has been deprioritized. 
* We will attempt to use iOS with simulator storing task created by user speech input, converted to text (JSON for web app, native iOS eventual macOS and VisionOS app UI with storable text that is saved in Apple Private Cloud via CloudKit). This is then integrated with Instacart to test out performance abilities using Playwright to see if an AI agent is able to handle storing a log of a task, completing a task and switching to another web application.
